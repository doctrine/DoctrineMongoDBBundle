DoctrineMongoDBBundle
=====================

This bundle integrates the [Doctrine2 MongoDB Object Document Mapper (ODM) library](https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm)
into Symfony so that you can persist and retrieve objects to and from MongoDB.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoDBBundle/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoDBBundle/actions)

Documentation on how to install and use this bundle is available in the
Symfony [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineMongoDBBundle/index.html).

The current version of this bundle has the following requirements:

Support for older Symfony, PHP and MongoDB versions is provided via the `4.7.x`
