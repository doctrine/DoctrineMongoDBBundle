UPGRADE FROM 4.6 to 4.7
=======================

## PHP requirements

* The bundle now requires PHP 8.1 or newer. If you're not running PHP 8.1 yet,
  it's recommended that you upgrade to PHP 8.1 before upgrading the bundle.

* The `fixture_loader` configuration option was deprecated and will be removed
  in 5.0.
* The `doctrine_mongodb.odm.fixture_loader` parameter has been removed.
* Implementing `ContainerAwareInterface` on fixtures classes is deprecated,
  use dependency injection instead.
